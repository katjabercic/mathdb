# The MathDB Catalogue 2.0

## History

The MathDB catalogue is a list of mathematical collections and databases. 
It was started at [KWARC](https://kwarc.info) by [Katja Berčič](https://www.fmf.uni-lj.si/en/directory/742/bercic-katja/),
primarily to help design [MathDataHub](https://data.mathhub.info).

The main contents of the catalogue are available as an overview table at [mathdb.mathhub.info](https://mathdb.mathhub.info/).
This page serves as a place to keep information that needs to still be entered into the table, 
or that simply does not fit into the table.

Collections and databases that are not yet entered in the overview table are listed in the section [TODO](#TODO).

[Go up](#Index) to index.

Some additional features to consider for databases:  query API, license, ...

Sometimes it makes more sense to just generate objects on the fly.  Are there systems that partly store, partly generate on the fly? (Small Groups in GAP?)

## Fingerprints and related

Most collections contain mathematical objects (encoded in some way), each object typically has some extra data.  What is the nature of these data and how do the collection's authors refer to it (i.e. data, invariants, properties, some kind of fingerprints)?  In particular, if the collection uses fingerprints, what is their nature?

For fingerprinting resources, see the [papers](#Papers).

## Querying

What kind of querying does the collection support?  Do the queries only use the object data or do they look at the structure of encoded objects directly in some way?
